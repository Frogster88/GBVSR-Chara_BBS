# GBVSR-Chara_BBS
All extracted BBScript files for characters in GBVSR

EX Characters are internally saved under the folder titled `(CharaID) EX`, but their files are saved under just `(CharaID)`. For clarification, those have been renamed to `(CharaID) EX` and `(CharaID) EXEF` for conveninience.
Character frame data and such will be in the file `BBS_(CharaID)`, while effects and other things to make the character work are in `BBS_(CharaID)EF`.
